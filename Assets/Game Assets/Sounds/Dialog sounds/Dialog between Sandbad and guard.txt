Sandbad (S): Excuse me, guard. I seek information about my brother. I've heard he's been imprisoned. Can you tell me why?

Guard (G): State your name and your brother's. We don't share information lightly.

S: I am Sandbad, and my brother is Liam. I need to know the charges against him. What crime has he committed?

G: Sandbaad, is it? Liam is accused of conspiring against the kingdom. There are serious charges of treason and espionage.

S: Treason? Liam would never betray our kingdom! What evidence do you have?

G: We have intelligence reports and witness testimonies. The authorities believe he has been involved in secret dealings with a rival faction.

S: (Frustrated) This is absurd! Liam is loyal to our kingdom. There must be a mistake.

G: We follow orders, Aiden. If you believe there's been an error, you can appeal to the higher authorities. They will review the case.

S: I demand to see Liam. I need to hear his side of the story.Can you help me with that?

G: Visitation is allowed, but under strict supervision. I can arrange for you to speak with him, but keep in mind that the evidence against him is substantial.

S: Thank you. I'll speak with him, and we'll get to the truth of this matter.

G: Be aware, Sandbaad, that interfering with the legal process can have severe consequences. If your brother is innocent, let the justice system run its course.

S: I understand, but I won't stand idly by if he's falsely accused. I'll get to the bottom of this.
